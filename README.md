Link to my Tableau assignment : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohamad.kassim/viz/Module14Assignment_16380887789960/Story1?publish=yes

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We wanted to solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. We needed to review the bicycle trip durations (Hours & Minutes) by many factors such as:
- Gender
- Weekdays
- Usetype

### Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

I was able to show the following information in the story:
- Checkout Times for Users:
  - Here we wanted to have an overview of the of the time spent on a bicycle.
- Checkout Times for Gender:
  - Then we breakdown this overview level by gender. This was we can see how the Tripduration is effected by gender.
- Trips by Weekday per Hour: 
  - We wanted to create a heatmap that would show what time of day these bike were used the most amongs all of the genders.
- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
  - Then we seperated the heatmap by Gender. This shows that Females and males use bicycles durnig the same time periods. However, there are a higer concentration of men using these bicycles.
- User Trips by gender by Weekday
  - We then wanted to break down the heatmap by "Usertype". We see that the Males had more subscriptions than females.

### Summary:

Reviewing this I was able to determine that Males and Females has similar trip patterns. However, Male users were more concentrated in this analysis.
